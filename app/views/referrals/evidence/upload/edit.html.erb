        <p>Signed and dated documents are better than unsigned ones. If they were not signed at the time of being written,
        ask the parties involved to sign and date a statement confirming their accuracy.</p>
        <p>Do not redact any of the documents. This will make it difficult to consider the evidence. All
        information given is treated in strict confidence.</p>
