        Evidence and supporting information
      </h1>

      <p>For example:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>file notes concerning conduct, behaviour, attitude</li>
        <li>statements made by the person youâ€™re referring</li>
        <li>documents of internal investigations and outcomes</li>
        <li>documentation of any past disciplinary action and complaints</li>
        <li>investigation and reports from the police or local authority</li>
        <li>signed witness statements</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Signed and dated documents are better than unsigned ones. If they were not signed at the time of being written,
      ask the parties involved to sign and date a statement confirming their accuracy.</p>

      <p>Do not redact any of the documents. This will make it difficult to consider the evidence. All
      information given is treated in strict confidence.</p>
