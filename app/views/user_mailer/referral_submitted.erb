# What happens next

Your referral will usually be reviewed within 3 working days. It may be longer if more information is needed.

It could be decided that:

* the case will not be investigated, for example because it’s unlikely the teacher will be stopped from teaching
* a formal investigation will be launched

You’ll be sent an email with the decision.
