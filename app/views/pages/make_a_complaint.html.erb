      Every school in England must have a complaints policy. It’s usually
      available on the school’s website or from the school office.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk_body">
      You may also be able to complain to your local council or organisations
      such as the school inspectors Ofsted. This depends on the type of school
      and what you’re complaining about.
