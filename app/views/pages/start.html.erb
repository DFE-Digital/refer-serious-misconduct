      The Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) will only investigate cases where the misconduct is serious enough to potentially result in a teacher being stopped from teaching (known as a ‘prohibition order’).
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You should provide any evidence to support your allegation, for example signed witness statements or previous complaints against the teacher.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      All cases of incompetence and less serious misconduct should be dealt with by employers.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long it will take to complete your referral</h2>
    <p class="govuk_body">
      You should allow an hour or more to complete your referral. The time it will take depends on the case. It will be faster if you’ve prepared the evidence.
