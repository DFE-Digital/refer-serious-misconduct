      <p>You must send all available information. A decision whether to begin an investigation will be based on the evidence provided. We may not contact you for additional information before making a decision.</p>

      <p>For example:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>complaint made to the school</li>
        <li>correspondence with the school</li>
        <li>school complaints policy</li>
        <li>complaint made to the police</li>
        <li>complaint made to the local authority or any other agency or body</li>
        <li>signed witness statements</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You must have the appropriate permission to send some documents to us, for example, if you are providing any documents from Family Court proceedings, then the appropriate permission from the Family Court should be obtained before they are sent to us.</p>

      <p>Make sure the file names describe the content, for example ‘signed witness statement’.</p>
