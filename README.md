# Refer Serious Misconduct

A step-by-step guide to reporting a teacher for serious misconduct.

## Dependencies

- Ruby 3.x
- Node.js 16.x
- Yarn 1.22.x
- PostgreSQL 13.x
- Redis 6.x

## Local development dependencies

- Graphviz 2.22+ (brew install graphviz) to generate the [domain model diagram](#domain-model)

## How the application works

Refer Serious Misconduct is a monolithic Rails app built with the GOVUK Design System.

We keep track of architecture decisions in [Architecture Decision Records
(ADRs)](/adr/).

We use `rladr` to generate the boilerplate for new records:

```bash
bin/bundle exec rladr new title
```

## Setup

### Bare metal

Install dependencies using your preferred method, using `asdf` or `rbenv` or `nvm`. Example with `asdf`:

```bash
# The first time
brew install asdf # Mac-specific
asdf plugin add azure-cli
asdf plugin add ruby
asdf plugin add nodejs
asdf plugin add yarn
asdf plugin add postgres
asdf plugin add redis

# To install (or update, following a change to .tool-versions)
asdf install
```

If installing PostgreSQL via `asdf`, you may need to set up the `postgres` user:

```bash
pg_ctl start
createdb default
psql -d default
> CREATE ROLE postgres LOGIN SUPERUSER;
```

If the install step created the `postgres` user already, it won't have created one
matching your username, and you'll see errors like:

`FATAL: role "username" does not exist`

So instead run:

```bash
pg_ctl start
createdb -U postgres default
```

You might also need to install `postgresql-libs`:

```bash
sudo apt install libpq-dev
sudo pacman -S postgresql-libs
sudo pamac install postgres-libs
sudo yum install postgresql-devel
sudo zypper in postgresql-devel
```

If installing Redis, you'll need to start it in a separate terminal:

```bash
redis-server
```

Setup the project (re-run after `Gemfile` or `package.json` updates, automatically restarts any running Rails server):

```bash
bin/setup
```

Run the application on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
bin/dev
```

### Docker

To run the application locally in production mode (to test that the container
builds and runs successfully):

```bash
docker build .
docker run --net=host --env-file .env.development <SHA>
```

### Linting

To run the linters:

```bash
bin/lint
```

### Testing

To compile assets up front (needed by the end to end tests):

```bash
bin/rails assets:precompile
```

To run the tests (requires Chrome due to
[cuprite](https://github.com/rubycdp/cuprite)):

```bash
bin/test
```

### Intellisense

[solargraph](https://github.com/castwide/solargraph) is bundled as part of the
development dependencies. You need to [set it up for your
editor](https://github.com/castwide/solargraph#using-solargraph), and then run
this command to index your local bundle (re-run if/when we install new
dependencies and you want completion):

```sh
bin/bundle exec yard gems
```

You'll also need to configure your editor's `solargraph` plugin to
`useBundler`:

```diff
+  "solargraph.useBundler": true,
```
